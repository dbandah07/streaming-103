# Stream Service - C++

## Overview
This program is a **C++ implementation of a simplified content streaming service** that models how users interact with media platforms.  
It manages users, content, and viewing activity while processing structured input to simulate real-world streaming service behavior.

The project emphasizes **object-oriented design, modular architecture, file parsing, and system-level programming**, using custom and JSON parsers to separate concerns and improve extensibility. A `Makefile` is included to standardize the compilation process, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.

## Features
- User account management and tracking
- Media content storage and retrieval
- Command-driven interaction system
- Custom and JSON-based input parsing
- Modular design separating content, users, parsing, and service logic
- Test files for validating functionality

## Notes
Completed during Spring 2025.
